## SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

## Background

TCCA, which is the aviation authority for Canada, has issued TCCA AD CF2021-01, dated January 8, 2021 (TCCA AD CF-2021-01) (also referred to as the Mandatory Continuing Airworthiness Information, or the MCAI), to correct an unsafe condition for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD500-1A11 airplanes.

The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 CFR part 39 by adding an AD that would apply to certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. The NPRM published in the Federal Register on August 25, 2021 (86 FR 47424). The NPRM was prompted by reports of loose powerplant FIREX interconnection hoses, and in one instance a hose was found disconnected. An investigation by the manufacturer determined that if the instructions for connecting the FIREX hose are not followed properly, hoses can become loose or disconnected. The NPRM proposed to require replacing certain existing FIREX hose assemblies with a newly designed FIREX hose assembly, as specified in TCCA AD CF-2021-01.

The FAA is issuing this AD to address the possibility that fire extinguishing agent may not be effectively applied should a fire occur within a powerplant assembly that has a partially or completely disconnected FIREX hose, which could result in the inability to put out a fire in the engine. See the MCAI for additional background information.

## Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive

## Comments

The FAA received a comment from Air Line Pilots Association, International, who supported the NPRM without change.

The FAA received an additional comment from Delta Air Lines. The following presents the comment received on the NPRM and the FAA's response.

## Request to Withdraw the Proposed AD

Delta Air Lines (DAL) requested that the FAA withdraw the proposed AD. DAL stated that it had already accomplished the required actions of paragraph (g) of the proposed AD by accomplishing the actions specified in Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Service Bulletin (SB) BD500-262003 Issue 002, dated January 7, 2020.

The FAA does not agree with the request to withdraw this AD. Even though DAL is the only current U.S. operator of the applicable airplanes, the AD must still be issued in case of any future imports of the airplanes.

## Conclusion

The FAA reviewed the relevant data, considered the comments received, and determined that air safety requires adopting this AD as proposed. Except for minor editorial changes, this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. None of the changes will increase the economic burden on any operator. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

## Related Service Information under 1 CFR Part 51

TCCA AD CF-2021-01 describes procedures for replacing certain existing FIREX hose assemblies on each powerplant with a newly designed FIREX hose assembly with provisions for the installation of safety cables at each end, in order to prevent the hose from becoming loose or disconnected. This material is reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

## Costs of Compliance

The FAA estimates that this AD affects 36 airplanes of U.S. registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:

## Estimated costs for required actions

| Labor cost                         | Parts cost   | Cost per product   | Cost on U.S. operators   |
|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 5 work-hours X $85 per hour = $425 | $13,012      | $13,437            | $483,732                 |

According to the manufacturer, some or all of the costs of this AD may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost impact on affected operators. The

FAA does not control warranty coverage for affected operators. As a result, the FAA has included all known costs in the cost estimate.

## Authority for this Rulemaking

Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.

The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

## Regulatory Findings

This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:

- (1) Is not a 'significant regulatory action' under Executive Order 12866,
- (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
- (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
